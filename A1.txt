How much time did the assignment take you overall?
One-two days;

Which areas of the assignment did you find easy and which ones were difficult?
Except the MovingSquare and the DrawImage areas are complicated and difficult for me to thinking, the others parts are easy. Because I can't figure out how to use MovingRectangle to extends MovingSquare and set the Square sides that inherit from Rectangle's width and height to be equal;

Which topics in the course did the assignment most help you understand?
Review quizzes;

Any other comments you would like to make.
